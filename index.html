<h2>Detailed Lesson Plan</h2>

<h3>Opening Hook (5 minutes)</h3>

<div class="teacher-note">
<strong>Teacher Script:</strong> "Before we start our video, I want everyone to close their eyes for a moment. Now, without looking, picture your bedroom at home. Can you see it? What color are your walls? Where is your bed? Good - you can open your eyes. What you just did - creating that mental picture - is a type of thinking. But is it the ONLY type of thinking? Today we're going to explore what it really means to think."
</div>

<p><strong>Quick Poll (show of hands or digital):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>"Who thinks animals can think?" (Most will say yes)</li>
    <li>"Who thinks computers can think?" (Expect mixed responses)</li>
    <li>"Who thinks a calculator is thinking when it adds 2+2?" (Most will say no)</li>
</ul>

<div class="teacher-note">
<strong>Teacher Note:</strong> Don't resolve the debate yet. Tell students: "Keep these questions in mind as we watch today's video. You might be surprised by your answers at the end of class."
</div>

<h3>Video Lesson & Quiz (10 minutes)</h3>

<p><strong>Video Content Overview:</strong> The 8-minute video covers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Multiple definitions of "thinking" and "intelligence"</li>
    <li>Human intelligence: abstract reasoning, problem-solving, memory, creativity</li>
    <li>Animal intelligence: navigation, tool use, social learning, communication</li>
    <li>Machine intelligence: pattern recognition, calculation, data processing</li>
    <li>Key insight: Intelligence isn't one thing - it's many different capabilities</li>
</ul>

<div class="point-opportunity">
<strong>POINT OPPORTUNITY:</strong> Video Quiz (5 questions × 2 points = 10 points possible)
<br>Students answer immediately after video for full points, or later for 1 point each.
</div>

<p><strong>Sample Video Quiz Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>According to the video, which of the following is NOT mentioned as a type of human thinking?
        <ul>
            <li>a) Abstract reasoning</li>
            <li>b) Telepathy</li>
            <li>c) Problem-solving</li>
            <li>d) Creativity</li>
        </ul>

            <li>d) Dogs following commands</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Reading & Comprehension (15 minutes)</h3>

<p><strong>Reading Assignment:</strong> "Three Kinds of Intelligence" - Students read digital text exploring:</p>

<div class="activity-box">
<h4>Reading Content Summary:</h4>

<p><strong>Section 1: Human Intelligence - The Flexible Thinker</strong></p>
<p>Humans excel at generalizing from limited examples, understanding context and nuance, creative problem-solving, and adapting to completely new situations. Example: A human child who learns what a "chair" is can recognize chairs they've never seen before, in any style or material.</p>

<p><strong>Section 2: Animal Intelligence - Specialized Excellence</strong></p>
<p>Animals often excel in specific domains relevant to survival: birds navigate thousands of miles, octopi solve complex puzzles, elephants demonstrate empathy and memory. Their intelligence is highly optimized for their ecological niche. Example: Arctic terns migrate 44,000 miles annually with extraordinary precision.</p>

<p><strong>Section 3: Artificial Intelligence - Pattern Recognition at Scale</strong></p>
<p>Computers excel at processing massive amounts of data quickly, recognizing patterns humans might miss, performing consistent calculations without fatigue, and handling multiple tasks simultaneously. But they struggle with context, common sense, and truly novel situations. Example: AI can beat chess champions but can't understand why we play games.</p>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> These aren't ranked - they're different. Asking "which is smarter" is like asking whether a hammer or screwdriver is better. It depends on the task.</p>
</div>

<div class="point-opportunity">
<strong>POINT OPPORTUNITY:</strong> Reading Quiz (5 questions × 2 points = 10 points possible)
<br>Questions test comprehension and application of concepts from reading.
</div>

<p><strong>Sample Reading Quiz Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>According to the reading, what is a key strength of human intelligence?
        <ul>
            <li>a) Processing data faster than computers</li>
            <li>b) Generalizing from limited examples</li>
            <li>c) Migrating long distances</li>
            <li>d) Never making calculation errors</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Why does the reading say asking "which intelligence is better" is like comparing tools?
        <ul>
            <li>a) Because intelligence is a human invention</li>
            <li>b) Because different types serve different purposes</li>
            <li>c) Because animals use tools</li>
            <li>d) Because computers are built with tools</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Thinking Examples Activity (15 minutes)</h3>

<div class="teacher-note">
<strong>Teacher Facilitation:</strong> Divide class into groups of 3-4 students. Assign each group to work on the digital worksheet together. Circulate to listen to discussions and ask probing questions.
</div>

<div class="activity-box">
<h4>Thinking Examples Worksheet</h4>

<p><strong>Instructions for Students:</strong> For each scenario below, decide what TYPE of thinking is happening. Is this human intelligence, animal intelligence, artificial intelligence, or a combination? Explain your reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Your dog hears you open the treat jar from another room and comes running, even though you haven't called them.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You're reading a story and predict what will happen next based on how characters have acted so far.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Your phone's GPS recalculates your route when you miss a turn.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 4:</strong> A crow watches you hide food, waits until you leave, then retrieves it.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 5:</strong> You realize you're hungry because you smell cookies baking, even though you weren't thinking about food.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 6:</strong> A music app suggests songs you might like based on what you've listened to before.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge Question:</strong> Which scenario involves the MOST complex thinking? Which involves the LEAST? Why?</p>
</div>

<div class="point-opportunity">
<strong>POINT OPPORTUNITY:</strong> Worksheet Completion (2 points for completing all scenarios)
<br>Focus is on thoughtful engagement, not "right" answers.
</div>

<div class="teacher-note">
<strong>Discussion Prompts While Circulating:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>"What makes you say that's [type] of intelligence?"</li>
    <li>"Could this involve more than one type of thinking?"</li>
    <li>"Is this an example of learning, or just responding?"</li>
    <li>"Would this work the same way if the situation changed slightly?"</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Wrap-up & Preview (5 minutes)</h3>

<div class="teacher-note">
<strong>Teacher Script:</strong> "Let's revisit our opening questions. Show of hands - who still thinks computers can think? Has anyone changed their mind? Why or why not?"
</div>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways to Emphasize:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Intelligence isn't one thing - it's many different capabilities</li>
    <li>Different types of intelligence excel at different tasks</li>
    <li>We can't simply rank intelligences as "better" or "worse"</li>
    <li>Understanding what thinking IS helps us understand what AI can and can't do</li>
</ul>

<div class="teacher-note">
<strong>Preview Next Lesson:</strong> "Tomorrow we'll explore three specific types of AI intelligence: visual AI that can 'see' images, auditory AI that can 'hear' sounds, and textual AI that can 'read' and 'write.' We'll discover that AI can be amazing at one type but struggle with another - just like how you might be great at math but find art challenging, or vice versa."

</div>

<h2>Differentiation Strategies</h2>

<p><strong>For students who need support:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Allow reading in pairs with discussion</li>
    <li>Provide graphic organizer for note-taking during video</li>
    <li>Offer word bank for worksheet scenarios</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For advanced students:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Challenge them to create their own scenarios for the worksheet</li>
    <li>Ask them to research and share an example of animal or AI intelligence not covered</li>
    <li>Have them consider: "Can something be intelligent without being alive?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Connection to Creative Project</h2>

<div class="activity-box">
<p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> This lesson lays groundwork for the semester-long creative writing project. Students are beginning to think about different types of intelligence, which will help them later when they:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create characters with different thinking styles</li>
    <li>Understand what AI can help with in creative writing</li>
    <li>Recognize the difference between AI assistance and human creativity</li>
</ul>
</div>
