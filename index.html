        <h3>Opening Hook & Course Introduction (7-8 minutes)</h3>
        
        <div class="activity">
            <h4>Welcome to Understanding AI</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Begin with energizing introduction to the course.</p>

            <p>"Welcome to Understanding AI. This course is different from any other class you've taken. You won't be writing code or solving complex equations. Instead, you're going to become AI researchers. You'll conduct experiments, document observations like scientists, and investigate one of the most important questions of our time: What is AI really doing? Does it think? Does it understand? Or is it something else entirely?"</p>

            <p><strong>Set Expectations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Throughout this semester, you'll work with an AI system called <strong>Alia</strong> - our AI Learning Assistant"</li>
                <li>"You'll conduct hands-on experiments to test AI's capabilities and limitations"</li>
                <li>"You'll keep a field journal documenting your discoveries"</li>
                <li>"You'll develop a creative writing project in collaboration with AI"</li>
                <li>"Most importantly: You'll form your own conclusions based on evidence you gather"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="activity">
            <h4>The Opening Question</h4>

            <p><strong>Display or write on board:</strong></p>
            
            <div class="question-box">
                "When you talk to Siri, Alexa, or ChatGPT - does it feel like you're communicating with something intelligent? Does it feel conscious, like there's someone 'in there'?"
            </div>

            <p><strong>Give 30 seconds silent thinking time, then quick popcorn responses.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="student-response">
            Students will have varied intuitions:
            <ul>
                <li>"Yes, it feels like talking to someone"</li>
                <li>"No, I know it's just a computer program"</li>
                <li>"Sometimes it seems smart, sometimes it's obviously fake"</li>
                <li>"It depends on what I ask it"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="teacher-note">
            Don't resolve the question yet. Say: "Interesting - we have different intuitions. Keep that question in mind as we start today's lesson. By the end of the semester, you'll have gathered evidence to answer it yourself."
        </div>

        <p><strong>Transition to core lesson:</strong></p>
        <p>"To investigate whether AI thinks, we first need to understand what thinking and intelligence actually are. Today's lesson explores three different kinds of intelligence: human, animal, and artificial. Pay attention to what each type does well and what it struggles with."</p>

        <h3>Core Lesson: Three Kinds of Intelligence (20-25 minutes)</h3>

        <div class="video-option">
            <h4>Choose Your Delivery Method</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Option A: Class Video Viewing (Recommended for Day 1)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play Lesson 1.1 video for entire class</li>
                <li>Students watch together on projected screen</li>
                <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Shared experience, easier to pause for questions, no tech issues</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately 20 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Teacher role:</strong> Pause at key moments for quick checks (see suggested pause points below)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Option B: Individual Reading</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students read Lesson 1.1 content independently</li>
                <li>Provide digital or print version of reading</li>
                <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Students work at own pace, develops reading comprehension</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 20-25 minutes (varies by reader)</li>
                <li><strong>Teacher role:</strong> Circulate, answer questions, monitor engagement</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Option C: Individual Video Viewing (with headphones)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students watch Lesson 1.1 video on individual devices</li>
                <li>Requires headphones OR use closed captions</li>
                <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Students can pause/rewind as needed, multimedia learning</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately 20 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Teacher role:</strong> Monitor progress, help with technical issues</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="teacher-note">
            <strong>For first day of course, Option A (class video viewing) is recommended.</strong> This creates shared experience, allows you to gauge student engagement, and establishes norms for how the class operates. You can transition to more independent reading/viewing in later lessons once routines are established.
        </div>

        <h4>If Using Option A (Class Video Viewing) - Suggested Pause Points:</h4>

        <div class="activity">
            <p><strong>Pause Point 1:</strong> After Human Intelligence section (approx. 5 minutes in)</p>
            <div class="question-box">
                Quick check: "Think-pair-share - Turn to a partner and explain in your own words: What makes human intelligence 'flexible'? Use the chair example or your own example."
            </div>
            <p><em>Give 60 seconds, then resume video</em></p>

            <p><strong>Pause Point 2:</strong> After Animal Intelligence section (approx. 10 minutes in)</p>
            <div class="question-box">
                Quick check: "What's one example of animal intelligence that surprised you? Why?"
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><em>Strengths:</em> Generalization from few examples, understanding context/nuance, creative problem-solving, adapting to novel situations</li>
                <li><em>Limitations:</em> Slow processing, gets tired, makes calculation errors, imperfect memory, can't process millions of data points simultaneously</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Each tool (intelligence type) is designed for specific purposes</li>
                <li>Using the wrong tool for a task leads to poor outcomes</li>
                <li>We should match intelligence type to task requirements</li>
                <li>Understanding strengths/limitations helps us choose wisely</li>

            <h4>Completion of Review Questions</h4>

            <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Ensure all students complete the 5 review questions</p>

            <p><strong>Important timing note:</strong> The 5 review questions are embedded at the end of the lesson content. Fast readers/viewers will have already attempted these during the Core Lesson time. Slower students may not have reached them yet. This final 5 minutes ensures everyone completes them.</p>

            <p><strong>Teacher says:</strong> "Everyone should now have the 5 review questions open on your device. If you already answered them, take a moment to review your responses and revise if needed. If you haven't gotten to them yet, complete them now. You have 5 minutes."</p>

            <p><strong>Administration format:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital (recommended):</strong> Questions are embedded in digital lesson or separate form (Google Form, etc.)</li>
                <li>Students can revise answers during this time</li>
                <li>Questions remain "open" until end of class period</li>
                <li>Teacher can see completion status in real-time (most digital platforms)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Alternative (if using paper):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide separate handout with 5 questions</li>
                <li>Students complete and turn in before leaving</li>
                <li>Note: Harder to allow revision with paper format</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="teacher-note">
            <strong>These are engagement/completion questions, not high-stakes assessment.</strong> For Lesson 1.1, all questions are multiple choice, making this accessible to all students on Day 1. Students should do well - this builds confidence and establishes the routine of completing review questions. Future lessons will incorporate short answer questions requiring written explanation.

            <p><strong>The 5 Review Questions:</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li>According to this lesson, what is a key strength of human intelligence that the "chair" example demonstrates?
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>A) Processing data faster than computers</li>
                        <li>B) Generalizing from limited examples to recognize new instances ‚úì</li>
                        <li>C) Remembering the location of thousands of objects</li>
                        <li>D) Never making calculation errors</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>What does the Arctic tern example illustrate about animal intelligence?
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>A) Animals can learn human languages</li>
                        <li>B) Animals are better at math than humans</li>
                        <li>C) Animals have specialized capabilities humans lack ‚úì</li>
                        <li>D) Animals use GPS for navigation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>According to this lesson, a crucial limitation of current AI is that it:
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>A) Cannot process large amounts of data</li>
                        <li>B) Recognizes patterns without understanding meaning ‚úì</li>
                        <li>C) Gets tired after working for too long</li>
                        <li>D) Cannot perform calculations accurately</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Why does this lesson discuss tools when addressing the question "which intelligence is best"?
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>A) Because intelligence is a human invention</li>
                        <li>B) Because different types of tools serve different purposes ‚úì</li>
                        <li>C) Because animals use physical tools</li>
                        <li>D) Because computers are built with tools</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>This lesson encourages you to investigate:
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>A) Which type of intelligence is most powerful</li>
                        <li>B) How to build your own AI system</li>
                        <li>C) Whether AI truly "thinks" and what that means ‚úì</li>
                        <li>D) Which animals are most intelligent</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="teacher-note">
            <strong>Collect review questions for quick assessment.</strong> Look for patterns:
            <ul>
                <li>If many students miss Q2 or Q3, plan brief review at start of next lesson</li>
                <li>These questions help you gauge whether students absorbed core concepts</li>

            <p><strong>Teacher Action:</strong> Build anticipation for Lesson 1.2</p>

            <p>"Today you learned about three broad types of intelligence. Tomorrow, we're going to zoom in on artificial intelligence specifically. We'll explore three types of AI that exist right now:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visual AI</strong> - that can "see" and recognize images</li>
                <li><strong>Auditory AI</strong> - that can "hear" and process speech</li>
                <li><strong>Textual AI</strong> - that can "understand" language</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You'll see real-world examples of each and start thinking about how they work - which will prepare you for Lesson 1.3 when you finally meet Alia."</p>

            <strong>During Lesson:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Video pause points:</strong> Listen for student ability to explain concepts in own words</li>
                <li><strong>Chart completion:</strong> Can students identify accurate strengths/limitations of each intelligence type?</li>
                <li><strong>Tool analogy application:</strong> Do students correctly match intelligence type to task?</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Review Questions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Success indicator:</strong> 80%+ of students answer 4-5 questions correctly</li>
                <li><strong>Red flag:</strong> Many students miss Q3 (AI limitation) - may indicate need to emphasize "pattern without meaning" concept</li>
                <li><strong>Common confusion:</strong> Students conflate AI capability with AI understanding</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Look For:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can students distinguish between AI and AC (Artificial Consciousness)?</li>
                <li>Do students recognize intelligence as task-specific rather than one-dimensional?</li>
                <li>Are students beginning to think critically about AI capabilities vs. limitations?</li>
                <li>Do students show curiosity about investigating AI more deeply?</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Differentiation Strategies</h2>

        <h3>For Students Who Need More Support</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>During independent reading:</strong> Provide guided reading questions to focus attention on key concepts</li>
            <li><strong>Visual learners:</strong> Create simple icons for each intelligence type (brain = human, paw = animal, circuit = AI)</li>
            <li><strong>Vocabulary support:</strong> Pre-teach: intelligence, generalization, specialized, artificial, consciousness</li>
            <li><strong>Simplified chart:</strong> Provide partially completed comparison chart with some examples filled in</li>
            <li><strong>Partner reading:</strong> Allow students to read with a buddy and discuss as they go</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Advanced Students</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extension question:</strong> "The lesson distinguishes AI from AC. Why do you think no one has created Artificial Consciousness yet? What might be required?"</li>
            <li><strong>Research task:</strong> Look up "AlphaGo" (mentioned in lesson) and prepare 1-minute explanation of how it learned</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophical challenge:</strong> "If AI can pass the Turing Test (fool humans into thinking it's conscious), does that mean it IS conscious?"</li>
            <li><strong>Early finishers:</strong> Read ahead to Lesson 1.2 or research one type of AI (visual, auditory, textual)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>English Language Learners</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide glossary of key terms with definitions and translations</li>
            <li>Use visual examples heavily (images in lesson are helpful)</li>
            <li>Allow extra time for reading if using Option B</li>
            <li>Permit use of translation tools during reading</li>
            <li>Pre-teach the metaphor/analogy concept (tool comparison may be unfamiliar)</li>
            <li>Pair with bilingual buddy for discussion activities</li>

        <h2>Extension & Enrichment</h2>

        <h3>If Students Finish Early</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Journal prompt:</strong> "Describe one experience you've had with AI. Based on today's lesson, which strengths/limitations of AI did you observe?"</li>
            <li><strong>Creative challenge:</strong> Draw or diagram the three intelligence types with examples from your own life</li>
            <li><strong>Research task:</strong> Find one news article about AI. Does the article distinguish between AI and AC? Is it accurate based on what you learned?</li>
            <li><strong>Thought experiment:</strong> If you could choose one superpower from animal intelligence (echolocation like bats, navigation like terns, memory like squirrels), which would you choose and why?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Optional Homework</h3>
        <p><strong>Intelligence Observation Log:</strong></p>
        <p>For the next 24 hours, notice examples of all three intelligence types in your daily life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 example of human intelligence in action (yours or someone else's)</li>
            <li>1 example of animal intelligence (pets, wildlife, videos)</li>
            <li>1 example of AI you interact with</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bring observations to next class to share.</p>

        <h2>Teacher Reflection Questions</h2>
        <p>After teaching this lesson, consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which delivery method (video vs. reading) worked better for this particular class?</li>
            <li>Did the opening hook generate genuine curiosity about AI?</li>
            <li>Were students able to distinguish between the three intelligence types clearly?</li>
            <li>Which examples from the lesson resonated most with students?</li>
            <li>What misconceptions surfaced that I need to address in future lessons?</li>
            <li>Did students grasp the AI vs. AC distinction?</li>
            <li>Are students ready to think critically about AI capabilities rather than being either over-impressed or dismissive?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Connection to Future Lessons</h2>
        
        <strong>This lesson lays the foundation for:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lesson 1.2:</strong> Three Types of AI Intelligence (builds directly on AI section)</li>
            <li><strong>Lesson 1.3:</strong> Meet Alia (students will investigate whether Alia shows characteristics of "thinking")</li>
            <li><strong>Lesson 1.4:</strong> AI vs. Traditional Software (expands on how AI differs from programmed rules)</li>
            <li><strong>Chapter 2:</strong> How AI Learns (explains why AI has pattern recognition without meaning)</li>
            <li><strong>All chapters:</strong> Students will continuously evaluate AI capabilities against human and animal intelligence benchmarks</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Key concepts students will return to:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Pattern recognition without understanding (foundation for bias discussions in Chapter 5-6)</li>
            <li>Task-specific vs. general intelligence (foundation for AI limitations in Chapter 2)</li>
            <li>AI vs. AC distinction (prevents anthropomorphization throughout course)</li>
        </ul>
